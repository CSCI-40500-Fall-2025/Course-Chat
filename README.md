# Project 8

## Product Vision

**FOR** college students **WHO** need real-time communication for collaboration and class updates, **COURSE CHAT** is a web and mobile service **THAT** allows students to register with their institution, add their classes each semester, automatically join classroom group chats, and easily connect with classmates without sharing personal contact information. **UNLIKE** generic chat apps, **OUR** product protects student privacy and builds a focused academic community where collaboration comes naturally.
